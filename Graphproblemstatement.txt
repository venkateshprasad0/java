All Paths from Source to Target Node
Description

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, count all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1, and return the number of paths.


The graph is given as follows: graph[i] is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i (i.e. , there is a directed edge from node i to node graph[i][j]).


Example:


Input:

If graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]], the input can be taken as follows:


first line: (number of nodes) 4

second line: (nodes you can visit from first node) 1 2

third line: (nodes you can visit from second node) 3

fourth line: (nodes you can visit from third node) 3

fifth line:( nodes you can visit from fourth node) -1


Note: input -1 implies no node can be visited from the given node.
